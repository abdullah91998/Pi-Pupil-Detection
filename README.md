# Pi-Pupil-Detection
This repository contains code from my thesis: *Embedded Pupil Detection on a
Raspberry Pi-based Wearable System*

## Eye-Tracker-Hardware

The hardware .stl files can be found in [Hardware](https://github.com/Lifestohack/masterthesis-eye-tracker/tree/master/models)


## Basic requirement
Since the development is done on both Windows and Raspberry Pi, parts of code can be run as standalone software.
To have the complete eye tracking experience with the [eye tracker](https://github.com/Lifestohack/masterthesis-eye-tracker/tree/master/models), the eye tracker has to be created.
